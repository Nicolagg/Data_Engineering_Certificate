# Project 15: Role-Based Book Collection Website
## Abstract
This project extends the Flask-based web development skills acquired in Module 11 to create a book collection website with role-based user access. Utilizing Flask-RESTful and Flask-JWT-Extended libraries, the website allows users to view a collection of books complete with cover images. Users are categorized as either 'admin' or 'reader,' each with specific permissions. A custom Python decorator ensures that only 'admin' users can add new books to the collection. Screenshots validate each step of the project, demonstrating successful implementation of role-based access and interactive features. The project serves as a practical example of combining backend logic with frontend design to create a secure and user-friendly digital library.
